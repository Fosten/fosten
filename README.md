## About Me ðŸ˜„
I am Fosten and I make things.
- My favorite softwares are [Plone], [FarmOS], and [Home Assistant].
- My favorite hardwares are [Raspberry Pi], [Arduino], and [Espressif].

I have been using Plone for over 20 years and contribute to [plone.org].
I am a proponent of [Agile]/[Scrum] methodology in open source software development
and find those practices are equally effective around the homestead and in the garden.
I enjoy many types of coding: frontend, backend, full-stack, devOps, automation, SEO, accessibility.
And with degree in writing/philosophy, I tend to bring a unique perspective to any project.
